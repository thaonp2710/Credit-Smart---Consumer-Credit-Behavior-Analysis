# Credit-Smart---Consumer-Credit-Behavior-Analysis
Credit cards have a significant impact on the financial system in the U.S., yet it could lead to
significant financial strain on consumers if they rely too heavily on credit cards and cannot repay
what they have borrowed. This study analyzes credit card trends, repayment behavior, and
financial stress from 2012-2024 using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's
Large Bank Credit Card Dataset.

These findings could help people to have a better understanding of how consumer credit card
behaviour relates to the economic shocks and find out indicators that can help consumers with
financial decision making, financial education and policy development to enhance the financial
stability of households.
